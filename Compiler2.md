A fancy declarative algorithm that implements member lookup, overload resolution and type inference for RelinqScript AST. Has much wider bag of tricks that can be used to resolve types than [currently used algorithm](http://code.google.com/p/relinq/wiki/JSToCSharp) (Compiler1). Prototype of Compiler2 is implemented by [RelinqScriptCompiler2](http://relinq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Relinq/V2/RelinqScript/RelinqScriptCompiler2.cs) and classes of [Relinq.V2.RelinqScript.Compiler2](http://relinq.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Relinq/V2/RelinqScript/Compiler2/) namespace.
